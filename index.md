# SNHU Computer Science ePortfolio

## Introduction and General Reflection

My name is Griffin Nelson and I was in the Computer Science program at SNHU for about four years. During my time in the program, I learned a lot about computers and various soft and hard skills that will help me in my future career.

Prior to entering the CS program, I was mostly self-taught in terms of programming. While my grasp on technical things like syntax and object-oriented design was solid, I did not have a good understanding of how an organization goes about developing software in a structured and stable way. However in the CS program I gained an understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This newfound understanding of how software is developed in an professional setting will help me in my future career in the software development field as I will understand how the organization I work for goes about planning, developing and releasing software and I will be able to optimize my workflow accordingly.

I also learned a lot about how to collaborate with my peers with modern version control systems like Git. Git is a powerful tool and there are many different ways to achieve the same outcome. However not all of these ways are conducive to an environment of collaboration. My better understanding of how to use decentralized version control like Git to contribute to larger projects will definitely help me in the enterprise software development world.

Lastly, in working with embedded systems and reverse engineering software I have gained a better understanding of how high-level languages like C and C++ are turned into machine code by the compiler. This better understanding of how high-level concepts like stack variables, heap variables and inline functions are expressed in assembly code will help me with optimizing high-level code and debugging issues caused by compiler optimization.
